# wifi-pwn
Android app to guess wifi passwords

# source
forked from https://github.com/faizann24/wifi-bruteforcer-fsecurify

# improvements (todo)
- clean up after having added a connection, otherwise Android will try the 10k passwds eveytime (DoS)
- clean up the project (bad splash screen implementation, poor code quality)
